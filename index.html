	Going solar for your home can be one of the best financial decisions you can make right now. Most homeowners’ common misconception about solar is that it’s too expensive and takes too long to see a return on investment. 

	However, that’s all now a thing of the past. The cost to install solar panels has dropped nearly over 80% in recent years making the process to switch to renewable energy very affordable. Additionally, federal solar incentives are also known as the federal solar tax credit can help aid with the cost of installing solar panels. This solar incentive alone allows homes the ability to deduct up to 26% off the total cost of installing a solar panel system. Furthermore, some local utilities and government offer additional solar incentives in select states which make going solar a NO BRAINER. 

	Recent studies from Zillow also show that installing solar panels may even increase the value of your home. With that said not all homes are a good fit for solar.
